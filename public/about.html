       <p>
        Our aim is to bring people together in an interactive online space to foster community connection, and to give them a tool to archive and share the stories that they care about. We hope our tool will increase visibility and amplify the voices of Philly residents in light of recent neighborhood changes while also acting as a living archive of the history of Phillyâ€™s neighborhoods. Who lives there? Who used to live there and what are their stories? How has the neighborhood changed from 20 years ago? Has it been good change? 
       </p>
       <p>
        <br> <br>
        Our goal is to
        <br>
        Inspire different neighborhoods with stories of resilience and innovation
        <br>
        Create self sustained community storytelling platform
        <br>
        Connect with people at the source i.e. churches, schools, public gathering spaces
        <br>
        Share stories for connecting, advocacy, awareness and celebration
        <br>
        Focusing on stories themselves and themes within communities without added logins or accounts
       </p>
        <p>
          We hope to include monthly programming as part of this project - focusing on a different topic each month to foster engagement. Below is an example of a prompt for Philly residents.
